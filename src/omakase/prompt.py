# RECOMMENDATION LANE: {LANE_LABELS.get(lane, "Best Match")}
Use the selected lane to decide tie-breakers. Best Match balances profile fit and franchise continuity. New Seasons strongly considers sensible continuations from loved franchises. Hidden Gems favors less obvious older or lower-visibility picks. Plan List treats the user's planning list as the candidate pool and warns about franchise risk instead of silently dropping picks.

# LOCAL FEEDBACK
{_format_feedback(feedback or [])}

# USER RATING HISTORY ({len(history)} titles)
Every anime this user has scored or interacted with. The scores are their honest ratings.
{_format_history(history)}

# CANDIDATE POOL ({len(candidates)} anime the user has NOT seen)
{_format_candidates(candidates)}

# HOW TO RECOMMEND

1. {analysis_step}
2. Identify what their highly-rated entries have in common that their low-rated entries lack.
3. From the candidate pool, pick the {n_recs} best matches. Be critical — a 7 is a solid recommendation, not everything needs to be a 10.

For each recommendation provide:
- title (use English if available, else romaji)
- predicted_score (1-10 — be honest, don't inflate)
- reasoning ({"2-3 sentences tying it to SPECIFIC anime they've scored AND to their written taste profile" if has_profile else "2-3 sentences tying it to SPECIFIC anime they've scored that share the same elements"})
- best_match_from_history (one title from their history this most resembles)

# STRICT RULES
- Do NOT recommend any anime the user has already seen or that appears in their history
- Do NOT recommend sequels, side stories, movies, OVAs, specials, or spin-offs tied to low-rated, DROPPED, or PAUSED history unless you explicitly explain why the later entry is structurally different.
- Prefer sensible next missing entries in loved franchises when they appear in the candidate pool.
- Label airing shows in the reasoning when airing status affects the pick.
- Do NOT recommend anything in the "DROPPED OR PAUSED" section
- Do NOT recommend anime that share an exact title match with anything in the user's history (watch for sequel series)
- Only recommend from the candidate pool — do not invent titles
- Do not output anything outside the JSON object

# OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON only — no prose, no markdown, no code fences)
